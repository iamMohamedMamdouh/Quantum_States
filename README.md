# Quantum_States

'''I'm excited to share one of the most fascinating projects I worked on recently during my journey into the world of Quantum Computing'''

In this project, I built a system to classify quantum states into three key categories:

ğŸ”¹ Pure States

ğŸ”¹ Mixed States

ğŸ”¹ Entangled States

Using quantum information theory concepts and tools like:

ğŸ“š Density matrices

ğŸ§© Von Neumann entropy

ğŸ§ª Quantum circuits (IBM Qiskit)


The system can:

 Detect whether a state is entangled
 
 Distinguish between mixed and pure states
 
 Visualize the state behavior on the Bloch Sphere
