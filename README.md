# Quantum_States\n

I'm excited to share one of the most fascinating projects I worked on recently during my journey into the world of Quantum Computing\n
In this project, I built a system to classify quantum states into three key categories:\n
ğŸ”¹ Pure States\n
ğŸ”¹ Mixed States\n
ğŸ”¹ Entangled States\n
\n
Using quantum information theory concepts and tools like:\n
ğŸ“š Density matrices\n
ğŸ§© Von Neumann entropy\n
ğŸ§ª Quantum circuits (IBM Qiskit)\n
\n
The system can:\n
 Detect whether a state is entangled\n
 Distinguish between mixed and pure states\n
 Visualize the state behavior on the Bloch Sphere\n
